How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Framework of choice

So many things are running on abandoned and outdated code. Sometimes you have to make something that you can use that helps your team out. This is where creating API's, databases, and other fun to use components comes in. I created some tools from open-source software and made some databases for helping update my own work. One of my projects needed a current database but I had no access to my jobs software. So I created my own tools to help create and stream line databases and quick onboarding for new co-workers.

Following the MERN full-stack usage(MongoDb, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js) of frameworks, tools, and libraries helped craft some tools at work. Dealing with certain challenges and my own innovation, I created a scanner for databases I created. This pulled me into learning how to run a server and maintaining an up to date database that changes every season.

Basic static pages that can have more complex and robust frameworks was my starting idea. Now I am focused on creating in future projects automated components. Soon I'll transition to server less functions and move onto other languages beyond HTML,CSS, and JS. Python coding in JavaScript will be more useful in my other projects(VFX, machine learning, AWS usage). The learning curve also as of late has been understanding security protocols, looking at how containers work, understanding QA testing, and finally learning how to even get better at documentation. I think most of the crucial work is lost when we fail to improve our documentation methods. Even spending time to understand simplified technical English writing styles and guides has shaped my approach to writing code.

Future updates to my coding will have a few repos that use the scanner, that have usage of a database to call, and the start of automating said projects. As of June 2022, it will be a targeted deadline for August 2022.

OPTIMIZATIONS

I planned to start looking at speeding up my load time for my pages. The next few edits include a usage of text to speech for accessibility usage. I am very excited to use W3C guidelines for my code and better practices usage. Eventually I want to work with more testers and supporters from the accessibility community.

Lessons Learned 

No matter what this all ends up as, I am eager and curious on learning how to build and use tools for my own work. It is lovely and awesome to see the communities that create and maintain tools for open source software. Every time I've learned one new concept and used it, another comes along and helps me get better at making it more functional. That is what makes this feel great. Having a functioning, simple, and working app is my goal. I had senior engineers, UI-UX designers, and sales team leads help me understand how to look at my app from a larger scope. Making things in object orientated programming, testing and updates, and reviewing UI interaction were the extra steps I didn't initially have as a programmer. Over the years I've found the model of scaling up projects to be more stable the more time I spend on pre-planning.

There are many more milestones to take on. 
So far the recent one (JUNE2022), has been JQuery for an autocomplete function. 
This tool was introduced by a great developer in my community (Mayanwolfe) and was shown to be helpful in making an autocomplete function part of the user interface/input.
